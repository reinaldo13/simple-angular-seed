# simple-angular-seed â€” a very basic and simple seed for AngularJS apps

This project is an application skeleton for a typical [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) web app.
You can use it to quickly start your angular webapp projects.

The seed contains a sample AngularJS application. It is all HTML, JS and CSS. It doesn't install anything else in your dev environment, so no dependencies! I did this on purpose so you have control over your web server, test and dev tools, etc.

The seed app doesn't do much, just shows how to wire two controllers and views together.

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the angular-seed repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites
